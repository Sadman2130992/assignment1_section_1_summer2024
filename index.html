    <p class="gochi-hand-regular">Money market refers to raising and deploying short-term resources, with maturity of funds generally not exceeding one year. MTB money market desk is one of the most active and efficient desks in the interbank market of the country. Main services of the money market desk are: Call Money.</p>

    inflation trend shows no signs of easing.

        After falling marginally in December, consumer prices rose again in January to 9.86 percent driven by an increased cost of non-food items.
        
        With the spike, annual average inflation crept up to 9.59 percent last month, way above the central bank's revised target of 7.5 percent for the financial year ending in June.
        
        This upward movement already raised questions about the effectiveness of the monetary tightening, which has been taking place for the last several months to contain demand.
        
        Since May 2022, the Bangladesh Bank hiked the policy rate or repo rate, at which it provides funds to banks and financial institutions, for the eighth straight month.</p>

<p class="gochi-hand-regular"> In January, the central bank increased the policy rate by 25 basis points to 8 percent in its efforts to make money costlier and curb excess demand in the economy.

    The interest rate on loans rose too as shown by the upward trend in the Six Months Moving Average Rate of Treasury bills (SMART), the benchmark rate for banks to fix lending rates.
    
    SMART advanced to 8.68 percent in January, a new high since the BB introduced it in July last year, moving away from a 9 percent lending rate cap, which was in place for more than three years. The shift aims at making the interest rate gradually market-based.
    
    Globally, except for tensions centring the Red Sea and some hikes in freight for the rerouting of ships, overall prices have been falling.
    
    In its latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said global inflation was expected to fall from 8.8 percent in 2022 to 6.6 percent in 2023. It may ease further to 4.3 percent in 2024.</p>

<p>Bangladesh, a net importer, is supposed to benefit from the decline.

    However, the data prepared by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, showed that there is no sign of a cooling in prices, leaving further room for policymakers to find the loopholes and plug them in.
    
    "We need to examine the source behind inflation and find out how much of demand is contributing to inflation and how much of it is coming from supply-side problems," said Mustafa K Mujeri, executive director at the Institute for Inclusive Finance and Development.
    
    Also, a former chief economist at the BB, Mujeri said inflation does not decline just after the increase in policy rates.
    
    "However, as the central bank is hiking policy rate and inflation is not reducing, there might be something in the supply side."
    
    "Problems related to supply exist. Here, the interest rate hike will not work alone. Other measures involving commerce and food to ensure smooth supply have to be taken simultaneously. Without that, the effect on prices is unlikely." </p>
