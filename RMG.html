<p class="handlee-regular"> This year's expected global slowdown could hit Bangladesh's key garment industry hard. We see the sector's exports growth falling by roughly 3 percentage points in 2023 as world demand for clothing slows. 

    This will add pressure on already-dwindling foreign exchange reserves and weigh on GDP. The damage could also be worse if persistent power outages at the country's factories cause overseas buyers to shift orders elsewhere.
    
    Growth in Bangladesh's garments exports falls by 4 percentage points for every 1 ppt that global growth slows, according to our calculations.
    In 2023, this should mean growth in apparel shipments decelerates to 24.4% from 27.6% a year earlier. The slowdown implies $1.5 billion less revenue than if shipments maintained last year's pace.</p>

    <div class="bottom">
        <p>Bangladesh’s garment sector has every prospect of remaining one of the world’s largest RMG manufacturers, and continuing its impressive story of growth and improvement. However, the country’s apparel industry is facing headwinds, and will need to take decisive action in several areas if it is to prosper. It will need to rise to the challenges of competing without preferential trade access; meeting decreased demand from traditional customer markets; and making a fundamental shift toward a demand-driven and more sustainable sourcing model. Some of the international buyers we spoke to believe the industry is not moving fast enough in this direction. Others are more positive: they feel that, given the resilience and adaptability Bangladesh’s manufacturers have shown in the past, the RMG industry will be able to navigate the necessary transformation, though structural changes will be inevitable. As Bangladesh celebrates 50 years of independence, global attention is focused on the remarkable economic and social progress the country has achieved in recent decades. Even with the setbacks of the Covid-19 pandemic, the South Asian nation is on track to become a middle-income country within the next few years. The ready-made garment (RMG) industry is a mainstay of this economic success story: Bangladesh is today one of the world’s largest garment exporters, with the RMG sector accounting for 84 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports. This comes on the back of the sector’s rapid growth and modernisation over the past decade as well as the strides it has made in improving conditions for the country’s approximately four million garment workers.</p>
