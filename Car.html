    <p class="handlee-regular" >Bangladesh is one of the most promising markets for the expansion of four-wheeled automobiles. The number of annual registered automobiles has more than doubled since 2013, amounting to about 26,000 units for passenger vehicles and 37,000 units for commercial ones (excluding auto-rickshaw, human hauler) in 2019.

        Although commercial vehicles are dominant, the growing purchasing power of middle-income population has spurred passenger vehicle registration. Due to steadily increasing per capita income as well increasing economic activity, the demand for both passenger and commercial vehicles is expected to grow at a rapid pace.</p>

    <p class="handlee-regular"> Automobile industry is one of the growing sectors in Bangladesh. Compared to the last decade, the growth of the automobile industry has gradually increased due to the socio-economic development and purchasing power of the middle and upper middle class of the country. According to BRTA data, the number of passenger car vehicles increased at a 5.43% CAGR rate from 2011-2020. However, compared to other Asian countries, the passenger car penetration is still very low in Bangladesh. There are only 2.5 car owners per 1000 population. In India, 30 people among 1000 individuals owned a car at the end of 2018. In Myanmar, about 12 people out of 1000 own a car. Higher tax rate on automobiles, inadequate and narrow national highways, high traffic density, high price of fuels, higher interest rate on private vehicle financing are responsible for the lower number of car owners in Bangladesh. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, sales of automobiles declined to its lowest in 7 years. In this article, we will discuss current trends and the future of Bangladesh’s automobile industry.</p>

<p class="khand-light">The use of motorized vehicles has increased significantly in the last 2 decades (2000-2020). According to The Daily Star, There were only 303,215 units of registered motorized vehicles in 2003 in Bangladesh. But up to MAY 2021, According to BRTA data, there were 4,729,393 units of registered vehicles in Bangladesh. Among them, 544,616 are passenger cars. The automobile market is again dominated by sedan cars, covering almost 68% of that passenger car market. The Remaining 12.40% are covered by Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and 19.27% are covered by microbus. Due to the increase in purchasing power, mass people are buying vehicles more than ever before.

    The purchase rate of cars increased dramatically till 2017. In that year, the number of total private passenger cars, jeep and microbus registered by BRTA reached 32,942. But the purchase of personal vehicles decreased in the next couple of years. In 2020, the number decreased to 20,093. Slower economic activity, adjustments in the financial market, higher tax rates, the popularity of ride-sharing companies can be the reasons for the fall. The covid-19 pandemic also hits the market to the worst. But it is expected that the automobile market will be back on track after the pandemic effect ends and the economy gets stable. According to The Daily Star, around 1 crore 20 lakh middle-class people of Bangladesh are earning enough to own a car and are willing to have one. This population class has a growth rate of 10% per year as well.</p>

<p class="khand-regular"> The Japanese reconditioned cars are dominating the automobile market of Bangladesh for a long time. But, currently the demand for Japanese reconditioned cars is slowly declining. In 2016, reconditioned cars almost covered 92% of the demand, and in 2020, it decreased to 82% of the automobile industry in Bangladesh. The tax difference between reconditioned Japanese cars and brand new cars became minimal. Currently, ‘NBR’ imposed tax on reconditioned vehicles based on their base value, not on their depreciated 2nd hand value, that made the car more expensive than the actual price. On the other hand, brand new cars are taxed based on the importer’s actual cost. So, the price difference between reconditioned cars and brand new cars becomes minimal and people are becoming more interested in purchasing brand new cars. Although the ‘Japanese Domestic Market (JDM)’ car is made only for use in Japan, the reconditioned ‘JDM’ is imported to Bangladesh. Peoples of Bangladesh prefer to buy Japanese durable cars. These cars have some features which are of no use for Bangladeshi users. Besides that, these cars come with outdated features, whereas brand new cars come with plenty of new features. </p>
